If you have already followed {numref}`ch1:install` - _Installing leafmap_, then you should already have a conda environment with all the necessary packages installed. Otherwise, you can create a new conda environment and install [pygis](https://pygis.gishub.org) with the following commands, which will automatically install leafmap and all the required dependencies:\n",
